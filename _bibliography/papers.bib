  abstract={Magnesium alloys are attractive options for temporary bio-implants because of their bio compatibility, controlled corrosion rate, and similarity to natural bone in terms of stiffness and density. Nevertheless, their low mechanical strength hinders their use as cardiovascular stents and bone substitutes. While it is possible to engineer alloys with the desired mechanical strength, optimizing the mechanical properties of biocompatible magnesium alloys using conventional experimental methods is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to streamline the alloy design process and reduce the required time. In this study, a machine learning model was developed to predict the yield strength (YS) of biocompatible magnesium alloys with an R2 accuracy of 91%. The predictive model was then validated using the CALPHAD technique and thermodynamics calculations. Next, the predictive model was employed as the fitness function of a genetic algorithm to optimize the alloy composition for high-strength biocompatible magnesium implants. As a result, two alloys were proposed and synthesized, exhibiting YS values of 108 and 113 MPa, respectively. These values were substantially higher than those of conventional magnesium biocompatible alloys and closer to the YS and compressive strength of natural bone. Finally, the synthesized alloys were subjected to microstructure analysis and mechanical property testing to validate and evaluate the performance of the proposed AI-based alloy design approach for creating alloys with specific properties suitable for diverse applications.},

  abstract={The development of bio-degradable implants has gained significant attention in recent years due to the ability of these implants to provide temporary support until the bone is healed and to biodegrade gradually, eliminating the need for secondary surgical interventions. Among the promising candidates for bio-degradable implants, Magnesium (Mg) alloys have received attention due to their bio-compatible and bio-degradable characteristics, as well as their physical properties which are similar to the human bone that can reduce stress shielding during load transfer at the bone-implant interface. Previous research on bio-degradable Mg alloys has shown that while these alloys have good biocompatibility and biodegradability, their mechanical behavior for cardiovascular substitutes can be less than adequate. The need for bio-degradability largely restricts the alloy design capability since only elements that are not toxic to human physiology (e.g. Ca, Sr, Zn, Mn, Li) can be used as alloying elements. The conventional alloy design, which is mostly based on trial and error, can take up to 10 years. Therefore, it is essential to explore new approaches that can help investigate the influence of a short list of alloying elements on the mechanical properties of biocompatible Mg alloys. In this study, a detailed data analysis was conducted using various machine learning models on a dataset made of literature data along with thermodynamics simulation data from FactSage software. The analyses were used to understand the relationship between microstructure, composition, heat  treatment, and mechanical properties of biocompatible Mg alloys. The findings demonstrate that the use of thermodynamic data, in addition to appropriate data preprocessing techniques, can be used for alloy design. The random forest model yielded the highest accuracy for predicting ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) with 90% and 91%  R2, respectively. The data analysis in this study also reveals the feasibility of using machine learning to understand the mechanical behavior of various alloys, which can pave the way for the development of advanced bio-degradable implants with optimized mechanical properties.}
