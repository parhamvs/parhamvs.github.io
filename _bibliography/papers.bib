  abstract={Magnesium alloys are attractive options for temporary bio-implants because of their bio compatibility, controlled corrosion rate, and similarity to natural bone in terms of stiffness and density. Nevertheless, their low mechanical strength hinders their use as cardiovascular stents and bone substitutes. While it is possible to engineer alloys with the desired mechanical strength, optimizing the mechanical properties of biocompatible magnesium alloys using conventional experimental methods is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to streamline the alloy design process and reduce the required time. In this study, a machine learning model was developed to predict the yield strength (YS) of biocompatible magnesium alloys with an R2 accuracy of 91%. The predictive model was then validated using the CALPHAD technique and thermodynamics calculations. Next, the predictive model was employed as the fitness function of a genetic algorithm to optimize the alloy composition for high-strength biocompatible magnesium implants. As a result, two alloys were proposed and synthesized, exhibiting YS values of 108 and 113 MPa, respectively. These values were substantially higher than those of conventional magnesium biocompatible alloys and closer to the YS and compressive strength of natural bone. Finally, the synthesized alloys were subjected to microstructure analysis and mechanical property testing to validate and evaluate the performance of the proposed AI-based alloy design approach for creating alloys with specific properties suitable for diverse applications.},
