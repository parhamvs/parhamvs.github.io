Having obtained a master's degree in engineering, I possess invaluable expertise in data analysis and research. What sets me apart is my strong adaptability and the ability to independently acquire proficiency in new software and tools, enabling me to remain at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field. Throughout my master's program, I dedicated over 2 years to engaging in research focused on data science and machine learning, effectively applying these skills to address practical engineering and biological challenges.

My enthusiasm lies in working with diverse datasets, rectifying issues related to data imbalances, and skillfully visualizing the outcomes to derive meaningful insights from raw information. Furthermore, I have a profound interest in leveraging machine learning and deep learning models to tackle a wide range of problems, including computer vision, and integrating them into various engineering applications. I wholeheartedly embrace the opportunity to contribute to any project that involves working with data, as my passion for this field knows no bounds. As long as there is data to work with, I am eager to participate and make a meaningful impact.
